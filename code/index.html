		<p>This is my personal website, which I seldom update. Actually, I
			never update it, so I decided to make it a purely static website;
			instead of keeping lots of sections that I'll never update, it's just
			this content below, and nothing else.</p>

		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a software developer, currently working for the <a
				href="http://wikilife.org">Wikilife</a> Foundation, amogst others.
			I'm a ArchLinux and OpenBSD user, and do both web and desktop
			software development in a few different languages. I'm an all-round
			computer geek, a light a gamer, and bit of a cinephile too.

		<!-- In case you're wondering "why is there a table instead of fancy CSS divs?",
		the answer is quite simple.  Because it's STUPID to used DIVS for tabular data;
		I want three exactly equal columns, a table is perfect, much in the same way a
		divs are perfect if you want non-equal columns.
		Use the right tool, for the right job.  Tables aren't deprecated, and it's due
		to a very good reason: they're useful is used properly! -->
