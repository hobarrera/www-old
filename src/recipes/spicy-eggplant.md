Spicy Eggplant
==============

Loosely based on something I once ate at an assian restaurant a long time ago, I tend to eat this quite often. It's a pretty fast recipe, with a spicy and somewhat sweet result.

Ingredients
-----------

 * cooking oil
 * 1 large eggplant, diced
 * 1 medium-sized onion, chopped
 * 1 medium/small red bell pepper
 * 1 medium/small green bell pepper
 * 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
 * 1 ground nutmeg
 * 1 spoon of cumin
 * 1 spoon of ginger
 * ground red pepper
 * 1 basil leave
 * soy sauce
 * 2 spoons of brown sugar
 * 1 minced garlic clove
 * 1 spoon of ground black pepper

Preparation
-----------

Heat some cooking oil in a wok. Note that the eggplant absorbs a lot of it, so use plenty to avoid it sticking/burning/drying out. Add a couple of spoonfulls of ground red pepper and stir plenty. Once the oil is heated up, add the eggplant, and let it cook for 2-3 minutes.

After those 2-3 minutes, add the onions, bell peppers, nutmeg, garlic, and cinnamon.  
Let that cook for another 2-3 minutes.

Finally, add the remaining ingredients, and cook for a few last minutes.
