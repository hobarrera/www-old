Tofu Pizza
==========

I improvised this after buying tofu for the first time. I had been reading some Thai recipes the last days, so I was kind of inspired by the style a bit (especially for the sauce).

This is a rather quick and tasty recipe, easy to produce for plenty of people.

One whole wheat pizza crust.

### Sauce

 * Three garlic cloves
 * &frac12; rocotto
 * 1 spoon peanut butter
 * Soy sauce
 * Olive oil
 * Juice of &frac12; lemon
 * &frac12; spoon curry powder

### Topping

 * Tofu, cubed in 10 to 20mm cubes
 * 3 small tomatoes, cut small
 * &frac12; carrot, grated
 * Scallion, about three
 * A handful of nuts, crushed
 * Coriander
 * &frac12; spoon curry powder
 * Lemon juice

Preparation
-----------

The sauce is done by simply mixing all it's ingredients in a minipimer.

For the topping, fry the tofu cubes with the curry powder sprayed on it, until it's outside is no longer soft. Mix this thoroughly with the other ingredients.

Spread the sauce on top of the crust evenly distributed, and add the topping onto that. Place the pizza into an over until it's well heated and the topping slightly cooked.
