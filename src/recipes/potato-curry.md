Potato Curry
============

I read about ~4-6 recipes, and then made this up using those as a reference. It's a pretty filling food, and one of the few dishes I know that's still really good once it's cooled down.

Ingredients
-----------

 * 3-4 medium-sized potatoes, cubed
 * 1 large onion, chopped
 * 5 garlic cloves
 * 1 cup broth
 * 1 tomato, cubed
 * cumin, ground pepper, curry powder, nutmeg and ginger
 * shredded coconut
 * &frac12; kilo of chickpea, left to soak overnight

I'd try using coconut milk instead of the shredded coconut as a nice variant as well.

Preparation
-----------

Boil the potatoes until well cooked.  
On a side, fry the onion and garlic until the onion is well done. Add the spices and broth, and cook for a few more minutes  
Add the tomato, chickpea, the potatoes, and coconut. Cook for 10 more minutes. Serve, and eat!
