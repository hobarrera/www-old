Ingredients
-----------

Ordinary supermarket crusts - at least until I learn how to make my own :D

### Filling

 * 150g of lentil, soaked a few hours beforehand
 * 2 bundles of spinach, chopped small
 * 3 cloves garlic, chopped small
 * &frac12; red bell pepper
 * 8 olives, chopped small
 * 1 spoonful ground red pepper
 * &frac12; spoonful of cumin
 * &frac12; spoonful of ground pepper
 * Olive oil
 * Soy sauce
 * &frac12; teaspoonful of nutmeg

Preparation
-----------

All that really needs cooking is the lentil, which you should boil until it's quite soft.
If you prefer to cook the rest slightly, it can be done with a wee bit of oil in a large wok. This will make the flavour of the spinach slightly less intense.

Preheat the oven slightly toward the high end, and cook until the crust looks well done.

Notes
-----

I should try addings callion and/or crushed nuts to this and see how that works out.
