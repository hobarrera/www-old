Almond Okara Cookies
====================
I first made these rather simple cookies since I had no idea what to do with all the leftover [okara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okara_%28food%29) the first time I made almond milk.

I'll update this as I refine the recipe.

Ingredients
-----------

 * 300g almond okara
 * 300g whole wheat flour
 * 1 teaspoon salt
 * 1 teaspoon baking powder
 * 150g raisins
 * 150g nuts (crushed)
 * Sugar

You might also need some (almond) milk if the mixture ends up being solid to manipulate.

Preparation
-----------

Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, until it's got a pretty uniform and maleable. Add some milk if it got too hard. Add more flour if it gets too soft.

I used a gas-based oven. Heat it to medium, put the cookies in, wait ~18 minutes, turn them around, wait another 18 minutes, and you're done.
