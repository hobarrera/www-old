Zafron Rice
===========

I actually added zafron to this recipe quite recently. It used to just be spiced rice with veggies, and the zafron was the final touch to reach perfection.

Ingredients
-----------

 * Broth
 * 1 cup of Yamani Rice
 * 1 large onion, chopped
 * &frac12; green bell pepper, chopped in cubes
 * &frac12; red bell pepper, chopped in cubes
 * 1 medium-large tomato, chopped in cubes
 * 1 medium carrot, chopped in small cubes
 * Cummin
 * Turmeric
 * Zafron
 * Ground Pepper
 * Ground Red Pepper
 * Cooking Oil

Preparation
-----------

Put the rice in a pot with three cups of water, at medium fire until it boils. One it boils, set it to a very minimum fire, and let it cooked until it has absorved all of the water.

You can prepare the rest while the rice is cooking, and should actually have time to spare.

Put the cooking oil in a wok (or a very large frying pan), and let it heat for a bit. Add about half a spoonful of ground red pepper, and leave if for a few seconds before adding the onion. Let the onion cook for a few minutes while stiring until it's slightly transparent-ish, and add the bell pepper. Let that cook for several more minutes until it's all done, and then add the carrot and tomato. Prepare the broth with a cupful of hot water and mix the zafron into it.

Once the veggies have been cooked, add the broth to it, and then the rice and the spices. Stir it for a minute or two while still cooking so it's all properly mixed.

Notes
-----

You can added chopped shrooms as an extra if you like. Just toss them in chopped along with the tomatoes.
