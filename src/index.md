About me
========

I'm an freelance software developer and consultant.  I'm very passionate about programming, unix, security, and somewhat obsessed with standards compliance. I do web, desktop and mobile software design and development, in a few different languages, my prefered one, being [Python](https://www.python.org/). I'm also currently working a researcher at the [University of Palermo](http://www.palermo.edu/).

I use [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on the desktop (and laptops) and [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org) (mostly on servers).  My browser of choice is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) (in great part due to their openness, but also due to issues that I can't stand in other browsers. I've also come love their dev tools over time), I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for small/medium projects, and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) for Java stuff (and most work-related stuff).  I use vi a lot for quickly editing files.  As far as notetaking in class, I've chosen [Xournal](http://xournal.sourceforge.net/), where I can switch between typing and drawing equations/graphs (using a [Bamboo Connect](http://www.wacom.com/products/pen-tablets/bamboo/bamboo-connect)) quickly and keep things tidy, and searchable.  I've never gained enough familiarity or speed with Latex to use it in class, though I wish I had the time!

I often get weird looks since I use [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) for email, but, after finding it to be faster and easier than any web-based or X-based email client around, I can't see myself moving to anything else.  It also has the added advantage that I always have a full copy of all my email locally at all times.  I do have an issue with managing contacts though, since I can't find anything that's not broken in some critical aspect.  I use [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) (with [XMPP](http://xmpp.org)) exclusively for IM, and XMPP is my preferred protocol, in great part due to it's openness and decentralization.

On a more personal note, I love cooking, and I do so a great deal.  Due to my love for openness, and strong conviction that knowledge should always be shared, it's only natural that I've started publishing [some recipes](/recipes) for stuff I do. It also helps me have it tidy in a single place for myself. I don't really have much spare time though, so what I've shared is pretty poor. I'm also experimenting with polyphasic sleep patterns.

If you want to get in touch, e-mail or XMPP (aka "Jabber", aka "Google Talk") are my prefered means of communication, and the most likely for me to reply.  Don't bother with social networks, since it's unlikely I reply via any of those. In case you need to send me something confidential, use my GPG public key to encrypt any message you may have.
