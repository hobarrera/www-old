My Website
==========

This repository contains my personal website, https://hugo.barrera.io/.

There's a small publication script included (which is still WIP), which pre-processes some file types before publishing.
Hopefully, someone will find some use for this (rather simple) script.

These are some features that are still pending implementation:

 * Process HTML file so as to use jinja2 templating.
 * Process TEX files and just publish the resulting PDF files (but don't version them!).
 * Pull submodules using git (for example, cv.pdf should be pulled from it's own repo).
 * [Done] Process [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) files into CSS.
 * Tidy up the code (this was a rather quick - and ugly - hack).

BTW, All this stuff is BSD licensed, see LICENSE for more information.
