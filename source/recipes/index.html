<h2>Recipes</h2>
<p>
    Since I'm such a lover of sharing and free knowledge, I've put up this section with recipes for stuff I cook or cooked. It's also a reference for friends who ask "How do you do ___?", and, for course, for myself in the future.
    <br>
    None of these recipes contain any dairies, eggs or meats of any kind, since I don't consume any of those under any circumstance.
