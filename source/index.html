<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    I'm an IT consultant and soft computing researcher.  I'm very passionate about programming, unix, security, and somewhat obsessed with standards compliance. I do web, desktop and mobile software design and development, in a few different languages.
<p>
    I'm currently working as a software developer for <a href="http://www.assia-inc.com/">Assia Inc.</a>, as a researcher at the <a href="http://www.palermo.edu/">University of Palermo</a> and I also do consulting on my own under the brand of <a href="http://ubertech.com.ar">ubertech</a>.
<p>
    I use <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a> on the desktop (and most laptops) and <a href="https://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> (mostly on servers).  My browser of choice is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> (mostly chosen because it's the one that has the least thing that annoy me), I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for small/medium projects, and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> for Java stuff (like most work-related stuff).  I use vi a lot for quickly editing files.  I use <a href="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/">Xournal</a> to take notes in class, because I can switch between typing and drawing equations/graphs (using a <a href="http://www.wacom.com/products/pen-tablets/bamboo/bamboo-connect">Bamboo Connect</a>) quickly and keep things tidy.  I've never gained enough familiarity or speed with Latex to use it in class.
<p>
    I sometimes get weird looks since I use <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> for email, but I've found it to be faster and easier than any web-based or X-based email client around.  It also has the added advantage that I always have a full copy of all my email locally.  I do have an issue with managing contacts though, since I can't find anything that's not broken in some way.  I use <a href="https://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> (with <a href="http://xmpp.org">XMPP</a>) exclusively for chat.

    <p>If you want to get in touch, e-mail or XMPP (aka "Jabber", aka "Google Talk") are my prefered means of communication.
    <p>If you need to send me private emails, use my GPG public key to encrypt them.
