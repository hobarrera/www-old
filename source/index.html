<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    I'm an IT consultant and soft computing researcher.  I'm very passionate about programming, unix, security, and somewhat obsessed with standards compliance. I do web, desktop and mobile software design and development, in a few different languages.
<p>
    I'm currently working as a software developer for <a href="http://www.assia-inc.com/">Assia Inc.</a>, as a researcher at the <a href="http://www.palermo.edu/">University of Palermo</a> and I also do consulting on my own, formerly under the brand of <a class="del" href="http://ubertech.com.ar">ubertech</a>.
<p>
    I use <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a> on the desktop (and laptops) and <a href="https://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> (mostly on servers).  My browser of choice is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> (in great part due to their openness, but also due to issues that I can't stand in other browsers. I also love their dev tools), I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for small/medium projects, and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> for Java stuff (and most work-related stuff).  I use vi a lot for quickly editing files.  I take notes in class with <a href="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/">Xournal</a>, because I can switch between typing and drawing equations/graphs (using a <a href="http://www.wacom.com/products/pen-tablets/bamboo/bamboo-connect">Bamboo Connect</a>) quickly and keep things tidy.  I've never gained enough familiarity or speed with Latex to use it in class, though I wish I had the time!
<p>
    I sometimes get weird looks since I use <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> for email, but, after finding it to be faster and easier than any web-based or X-based email client around, I can't see myself moving to anything else.  It also has the added advantage that I always have a full copy of all my email locally at all times.  I do have an issue with managing contacts though, since I can't find anything that's not broken in some critical aspect.  I use <a href="https://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> (with <a href="http://xmpp.org">XMPP</a>) exclusively for chat, and XMPP is my mail protocol.
<p>
    On a more personal note, I love cooking, and I do so a great deal.  Due to my love for openness, and strong conviction that knowledge should always be shared, it's only natural that I've started publishing <a href="/recipes">some recipes</a> for stuff I do. I don't really have much spare time though, so that section is pretty poor. I'm also a  sentiocentrist and experimenting with polyphasic sleep.

<p>If you want to get in touch, e-mail or XMPP (aka "Jabber", aka "Google Talk") are my prefered means of communication, and the most likely for me to reply.  Don't bother with social networks, since it's unlikely I reply via any of those. In case you need to send me something confidential, use my GPG public key to encrypt any message you may have.
